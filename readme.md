# Lexer Comparison: FSM vs Hand-Written

This C++ project compares the performance and structure of two lexical analyzers:

- **FSM-based lexer**: Uses a finite state machine model to tokenize input.
- **Hand-written lexer**: Implements custom logic for tokenizing without an explicit FSM.

The goal is to analyze code maintainability, extensibility, and performance under various input scenarios.
